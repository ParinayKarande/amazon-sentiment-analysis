# Amazon Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

This project was completed as part of the Master's course DSCI 633 - Foundations of Data Science and Analytics. It was a collaborative effort by a team of graduate candidates in the Masters in Data Science and Masters in Software Engineering programs. The project applies machine learning techniques to predict sentiment in Amazon customer reviews and extract insights through supervised and unsupervised analysis.

## Summary

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict sentiment in customer reviews. Key methods used include:

- Data preprocessing with tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming  
- Feature engineering using TF-IDF, word embeddings, and statistical feature selection  
- Supervised learning models: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Classifier  
- Unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering for pattern discovery  
- Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest  
- Deep learning with a Keras neural network  
- Visualization techniques including word clouds and PCA plots  

The models achieved approximately 94% accuracy in sentiment classification, providing valuable insights for businesses to understand customer feedback.
